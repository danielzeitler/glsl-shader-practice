# GLSL Shader Practice

Here is a summary of tools I use for my shader practice sessions. The focus of these sessions is to make it as easy as possible to play around with the fragment shader. With that in mind this setup has been proven to be useful:

#### Code Editor recommendation

For development [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used as an editor, with the following extensions:

- [Shader Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader) for syntax highlighting in shader languages, code completion and help with function and method signatures
- [GLSL-Canvas](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circledev.glsl-canvas) enables to open a live WebGL preview of the GLSL Shader.
- [GLSL Viewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer) is a GLSL live coding renderer for MacOS and Linux. This could be used instead of GLSL-Canvas. To start GLSL Viewer open the terminal and type in:

```
glslViewer yourFileName.frag
```

#### Useful Snippets:

[Lewis Lepton](https://gist.github.com/lewislepton/8b17f56baa7f1790a70284e7520f9623) provides useful auto-complete snippets for GLSL within VS Code.
